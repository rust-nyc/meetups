# Meetups

> Boostraper repo for organizing [Rust NYC Meetups](https://meetup.com/rust-nyc)

## Format

Rust NYC is always open to changes in format but the following components

### 🏡 Host

We need a venue that has a capacity for 50+ of our members to sit and some form
of a projector for hosting talk slides

### 🍕 Sponsor

Our members come hungry for knowledge and often pizza. Pizza is an expense
thats difficult to cover out of pocket for large crowds. We typically partner
with a sponsor, like our friends [Nace Partners](http://nacepartners.com/) that help
fill this need

### 🎤 Speakers

What keeps this community going is the interesting work the community is doing.
What keeps members coming back what they learn from hearing from others experiences
from working with rust

## Contributing

In order to run a successful Meetup we need all of the following to come together
once a month and we can't do that without your help. If you'd like to help
please open a github issue.
